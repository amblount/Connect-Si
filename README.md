## Minimum Viable Product
+ ~~A user can see a board~~
+ ~~A user can see a styled board~~
+ ~~A user can place a piece into a column~~
+ ~~Users place alternating black and red pieces on the board~~
+ ~~Users can't place a piece in a filled column~~

## Stretch Goals

+ Users have the option to play against the computer
+ Users are notified when there is no possible way for either player to win a game
+ Users and computers have a limited time to move
+ Users and computers have an aggregate time limit, like in chess
+ Users can play against a "smart" computer, that has an algorithm for determining the optimal move.
+ Users can play against a super "smart" computer, that optimizes its moves by making projections for future moves
+ A user can play against another user on a different computer, using Firebase.js
